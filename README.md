# Project DisCo

## Discrete Choreography
Project DisCo is an application to integrate bottom-up aggregation of 
modular building blocks and intuitive spatial design into Virtual Reality (VR).
It allows the designer to choreograph large amounts of building blocks 
interactively through physics simulations as a means of form generation.
